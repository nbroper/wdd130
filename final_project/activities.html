                    <h3>(3) 90 Minute Sessions $45</h3>
                    <p>This introductory class will help anyone interested in beginning their home garden by providing in depth instruction on tools needed, crop and seed selection, soil preparation, watering, garden maintenance, and crop harvesting. Come
                        prepared with questions and a general idea of what you would like to grow and we will help guide you so that you might have a successful harvest year after year. The principles we will discuss are the building blocks that will
                        help you cultivate a green thumb and are just as relevant in the vegetable garden as in the flower beds.

                    <h3>(4) 1-hour Sessions $60</h3>
                    <p>This class is a great introduction to gardening and farming for kids and youth that enjoy playing outside and getting dirty. We split into groups based on age and provide age appropriate instruction. We talk about the lifecycle of
                        a plant and then plant seeds and watch them sprout and continue to grow through our continued sessions. We will spend time with our farm animals and learn what they need to be happy and healthy. This is a fun class with lots of
                        opportunities to grown and experience new things!

                    <h3>2 Hour In Depth Tour $15</h3>
                    <p>For years we have gotten requests for the tours that we do for school field trips and youth groups, this is that tour! This is a look into how a modern working farm functions and all the work that goes into food production. We discuss
                        how technology plays a major role in what we do and contrast that with the technology our great-grandparents used on this very farm in the early 1900's.
