        content="The Online Farmers Market website provides a method for small farms and
         residential crop growers to sell extra produce to the friends and neighbors.
         The idea is to give away or sell surplus produce so that it gets consumed rather
          than discarded after going bad."

            <h3>Site Purpose with Goals</h3>
            <p>What do you do with the extra fruit or vegetables you grow but can't 
                eat before they go bad? I have built a simple website that can help 
                you enjoy the FRUITS (or vegetables) of your labor. You can simply 
                add what produce you have along with a short description and a picture 
                and set meeting times before sharing it with others within pre-set 
                geographical boundaries. Whether you are looking to make a little extra 
                money from the extra food you grow or give recently harvested produce 
                away so it doesn't go to waste my site is a quick and easy way to help 
                you and your neighbors out.
