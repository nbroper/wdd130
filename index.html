    <p>Samuel Nelson Roper is the name of my second son.  He was born on the 25th of June, 2020.  There are a couple silly things about that.  First, he was due on July 4th and I had told my wife that I was going to give him a ridiculous sounding faux patriotic name if he was in fact born on that day.
        He wasn't, so we went with this name.  <em>Nelson</em>  is my mothers maiden name and I wanted to pay some homage to my moms family.  The second interesting thing about being born on June 25 is that its the <strong>perfect</strong>
day to be born if you're a kid.  Its perfect because it is exactly 6 months from Christmas.  You get presents every six months.
