    <p>Samuel Nelson Roper is the name of my second son. He was born on the 25th of June, 2020. There are a couple silly things about that. First, he was due on July 4th and I had told my wife that I was going to give him a ridiculous sounding faux patriotic
        name if he was in fact born on that day. He wasn't, so we went with this name. <em>Nelson</em> is my mothers maiden name and I wanted to pay some homage to my moms family. The second interesting thing about being born on June 25 is that its the
        <strong>perfect</strong> day to be born if you're a kid. Its perfect because it is exactly 6 months from Christmas. You get presents every six months.
