                <p class="mrap">Our family has been running these rivers for over a hundred years. Our ancestors settled in this area after coming west in the 1800's. Always a wiley bunch, they sought riches and fame prospecting and mining in the area. During the war
                    years they mined uranium and turned to the rivers to transport their ore and supplies to and from their claims. Never making much from this endevour, they continued to recreate on the water and explored everything that the rivers touched
                    in Southern Utah. After the Arches area was named a National Monument in 1929 tourists began to flock to the area. It was at point "Muddy River Adventures" was born, to take advantage of people who didn't know any better while trying
                    to cool down from the dry heat of the summer. Our company has been family owned and operated since that time. We take great pride and joy in being the oldest rafting outfit in the area and because of our familial knowledge of these
                    waters can provide an adventure second to none! Come, let us show you what our family has come to know over the decades, the beauty and splendor of Southern Utah.
