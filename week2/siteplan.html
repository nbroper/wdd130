        <h3>Site Purpose with Goals</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of the website is to provide information on river rafting
          in and near Moab Utah on the Colorado and Green Rivers. We also expect
          to add a reservation system including and interface with a shopping
          cart checkout capability. We will have company logo'd merchandise
          available to purchase as well as photos of tour groups to order after
          the adventures have taken place. We want to provide detailed
          information on when trips are available and for what price that is
          easy to locate on the site. We will also include detailed information
          on what to bring with you and what to expect while on the river. We
          will have reviews from previous patrons that highlight the adventure
          and rapids. A main goal of this site is to provide easy to access
          information for people who are planning their trips in advance or are
          trying to find availability during their planned trips.
